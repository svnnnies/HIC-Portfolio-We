# HIC-Portfolio-We
Portfolio Website

This portfolio website is designed to balance visual appeals, usability, and accessibility. By following the 8 Golden Rules that we learned and applying them, users can navigate the site confidently, and enjoy a personalized experience through the different themes that are implemented which are the light/dark mode features. Consistency, feedback, and visual hierarchy are central to the design, ensuring both that first time and returning users can engage efficiently.

The way I ran this is I downloaded the "Open in browser" Extension in VS code, and you right click one of the files and open in default browser to view.
